# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance
During this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data.

The aim of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans, which would enable the theoretical business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.
